# ?? DreamTeQ 360 ERP | Abim West Cluster
## Sovereign Engineering for .9M Agricultural Infrastructure

This platform serves as the centralized command and control center for the **Abim West Agricultural Facility**. It utilizes a Sovereign Engineering architecture to provide real-time visibility, bank-grade security, and geospatial auditability for stakeholders.

### ??? Technical Architecture
- **Runtime:** Serverless Python 3.12 (Vercel Edge Network)
- **Data Vault:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Service-Role Encryption
- **Frontend:** Zero-Latency HTML5/Vanilla JS with CSS3 Pulse UI
- **GIS Engine:** SVG-based Geospatial Mapping for regional cluster verification

### ?? Security & Compliance Protocols
1. **Sovereign Gate:** Access is restricted via a hashed Vault Access Key.
2. **Session Watchdog:** Integrated inactivity timer (10 mins) with automatic session termination.
3. **Byte Integrity:** Forced ASCII encoding to ensure 100% logic purity across Linux cloud environments.
4. **Audit Ledger:** Real-time, timestamped transaction ledger for all vault handshakes.

### ??? Deployment Strategy
The system utilizes a **Manual Build Override** configuration to ensure the Python runtime is compiled with absolute precision, bypassing standard static-file caching for maximum data integrity.
